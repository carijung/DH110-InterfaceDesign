# DH110 Assignment 6: Interface Design

# Description of My Project

With a goal of desiging a digital product that can help users of any demographic learn about sustainability, what is being done to reach the sustainability goals, and what they can do to help reach those goals, I chose to create a prototype of the "Sustainability Development Goals" page.

### About my Design Process
This part of my design journey was filled with trial and errors which helped me achieve the best color combinations and learn what must be taken into account when designing. For example, I had to reiterate the process of using Spark to check my color combination ratios. Fter trying many color combinations, I realized that getting rid of certain colors actually helped with visibility and made the website less overwhelming. 

Below is my finalized example wireframe of the "Sustainability Development Goals" page:

### About the Purpose of Interface Design
The purpose of interface design is to digitize and make our low-fidelity prototypes more sophisticated and realistic. It is a meaningful process that takes various possibilities into account like visual impairments, readability, legibility, etc.

## Design System
> I chose to design the "Sustainable Development Goals" page. I made this choice because this page seemed to be hiding resourceful features like the interactive chart on the seventeen goals. I wanted this feature to be visible to the users the moment they navigated to this page since the title of the page implies that there would be goals. 

### Typographic Variations

> The font Nunito was the best option because it maintained professionality and the rounded letters seemed to radiate kindness/friendliness that would make user's feel welcomed to read or unhesitant. Also, it's minimality made it legible especially because the letters were nicely spaced out. Even when I applied this font throughout my prototype, it wasn't overwhelming to one's eyes.

### Color Schemes

> I wanted to test two options: green buttons or blue buttons. I found that the blue button would be a better choice because it's UNEP's core color and the color green seems to already be redundant throughout the page. Depending on a user's technical skills, we would expect that clicking on the logo (top left corner) would lead us back to the homepage since this is the case for majority of the websites. Because the logo is blue, I also wanted to make the buttons blue to imply that it is clickable like the logo. 


### Shape Variations

> Instead of making the sustainability goals icons a flat image, I applied a 20 pixel radius that rounded the corners but to a certain extent that a square shape was maintained. I wanted to keep the rectangle/square shape consistent throughout my prototype. I also added a shadow to emphasize the clickability and make the icons resemble a button. I didn't choose to apply a radius of 40 pixels because the text of the icons would be cropped and it would've made an ambiguous shape of something between a circle and a square. 
 
### Layout
> For the layout, I made 6 columns with type 'stretch', with a margin of 172 pixels, and a 20 pixel gutter. This ensured that the elements wouldn't be full screen and overwhelm any users and making them zoom out or scroll endlessly to reach the end of the page. These columns also created six columns for where the icons of the sustainability goals would be placed. Furthermore, I only added 3 rows with type 'top', a height of 166 pixels, an offset of 1455 pixels, and a gutter of 23 pixels that overlapped with the column layouts and created a square where each individual icon could be placed.
